About IVY DEV HUB

IVY DEV HUB is a community-driven platform for developers and aspiring coders to work together on challenging and interactive projects. Each week, we explore a new project focusing on specific programming topics, starting with Python and expanding to other languages over time.
Project Submission Guidelines

To keep things organized, please follow these guidelines when submitting a project:

    File Naming: Use the format username_project-topic for your project folder.
    Language-Specific: For projects in different languages, ensure each language has its respective folder (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.)
    Pull Request: Submit your project as a pull request. After review, your project will be merged for the community to see.

Project Structure

Each project should include:

    README.md: Describe the project, your approach, and any specific instructions for running the code.
    Main Code Files: Your main program files, appropriately named according to the language or topic.
    Resources Folder (optional): For any additional files or assets.

Example Project Layout:
